      Include all SharedPreferences files.
      This is the most important rule for your app, as it saves user settings
      like the "auto-zoom" preference. The path "." means include all files
      in this category.

    <!--
      Include all database files.
      Even if you don't use a database right now, this rule ensures that if you
      add one later (e.g., to save scan history), it will be backed up automatically.
